\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The US National Weather Service issues weather alerts in the event of an upcoming severe weather event. These alerts trigger alerting systems that can launch news, internet, and mobile messages to warn the public of threats to life and property. These alerts however do not have a structured measure to indicate the severity of the weather event. As a result, a storm that passes by and causes little or no damage may have the same Severe Thunderstorm Warning as the 2012 derecho that killed 22 people across seven states and left 4.2 million without power for an extended period.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the severity of an upcoming storm event based on the free-text descriptions and instructions inside the public alerts. 

\section{Research Questions} 
\label{researchquestions}

1.	Is there a relationship between certain keywords or patterns in the public alerts text descriptions and the resulting impact of a weather event?

2.	Can we come up with a useful structured measure to indicate the severity of an upcoming weather alert that the NWS can use to improve alert content?

\section{Related Work}
\label{related}

To be completed..

\section{Data Sets}
\label{datasets}

For this project, we already have access to two datasets (discussed below). While we would like to have additional information on topics such as school closings and power outages, it does not appear as if this data is readily available. As such, we will work with what we have.

\subsection{National Weather Service Alert Database}
Google has given us access to a database of hundreds of thousands of alerts issued by the National Weather Service. The alerts span from November 2011 to February 2013 and are using the Common Alert Protocol (CAP) format. Useful information can be found inside each alert including geographic locations, dates/times, and free text describing the alert.

\subsection{NOAA Storm Events Database}

The Storm Events Database is a collection of storm reports maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \cite{stormevents}. Each report documents a particular weather-related event and includes valuable information such as geographic locations, dates/times, injuries, deaths, and property damage.

\section{Technology Summary}
\label{technologysummary}

\subsection{Python 2.7}
\subsubsection{NumPy}
NumPy is a highly efficient and robust scientific computing Python package \cite{numpy}. We will use NumPy to store our large data sets 
\subsubsection{NWS-CAP-Parser}
NWS-CAP-Parser is a Python class that parses the XML of a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) message issued by the National Weather Service (NWS)\cite{nws-cap-parser}.

\subsubsection{Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)}
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data \cite{nltk}. We will be using it extensively for its tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and n-gram functions.

\subsubsection{Scikit-Learn}
Scikit-learn is a simple and efficient machine learning package for Python \cite{scikit-learn}. It will be used to train various models after the feature engineering and extraction stages are complete.

\subsection{Google Compute Engine}
Google Compute Engine allows large-scale computing workloads on the same infrastructure that runs Google Search, Gmail and Ads \cite{compute-engine}. Due to the size of the data sets that will be discussed in section \ref{datasets}, and the fact that our work may be used in their products, Google was kind enough to donate ample computing resources via this new service.

\section{Proposed Milestones}
\label{milestones}

\subsection*{Week 1 (02/25 - 03/03)}
Draft formal project proposal\\
02/28 - Project Proposal Due

\subsection*{Week 2 (03/04 - 03/10)}
Match NWS alerts with events in Storm Event Database.

\subsection*{Week 3 (03/11 - 03/17)}
03/11 - Monthly Meeting with Project Advisor (Alice)\\
03/12 - Revised Project Proposal Due\\
\\
Extract features from alerts. We intend on using most of the fields within the alert as a separate feature. The free text fields will likely be tokenized, have stopwords removed, stemmed, and have bigrams generated. 

\subsection*{Week 4 (03/18 - 03/24)}
Spring Break\\
\\
Continue extracting features from alerts. Depending on the total number of alerts and time constraints, we may opt to go back and extract trigrams instead of bigrams.

\subsection*{Week 5 (03/25 - 03/31)}
Build property damage model and test. We want to see if we can make a model that says "given a CAP alert, predict the amount of property damage that the storm will cause"

\subsection*{Week 6 (04/01 - 04/07)}
Build death prediction model and test. Similar to the damage model, we would like to predict the number of deaths that will result from the storm.

\subsection*{Week 7 (04/08 - 04/14)}
04/08 - Monthly Meeting with Project Advisor (Alice)\\
\\
Build injury prediction model and test. Again, similar to the damage model, one of the factors that goes into a storm's severity is the number of injuries.

\subsection*{Week 8 (04/15 - 04/21)}
Build framework that takes a CAP alert, extracts features, runs them through three prediction models, and computes a final storm severity.

\subsection*{Week 9 (04/22 - 04/28)}
Gather all results and begin drafting final report.

\subsection*{Week 10 (04/29 - 05/05)}
05/02 - Polished Draft of Project Report Due\\
\\
Start polishing the final report.

\subsection*{Week 11 (05/06 - 05/12)}
05/10 - Final Project Report Due\\
\\
Place finishing touches on the final project report.
